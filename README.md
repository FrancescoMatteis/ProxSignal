# ProxSignal

A minimal and lightweight reactive signal library for JavaScript and TypeScript with automatic dependency tracking and efficient caching.

## Philosophy

ProxSignal is a reactive signal library that provides a unified API for managing state and computed values in JavaScript and TypeScript applications. ProxSignal treats regular signals and computed signals as equals, the same `Signal` class handles both primitive values and derived computations.

## Features

-   üöÄ **Lightweight** - Minimal code footprint with zero external dependencies
-   ‚ö° **Performant** - Efficient caching and synchronous dependency tracking
-   üîÑ **Reactive** - Automatic updates when dependencies change
-   üéØ **TypeScript** - Full TypeScript support with type inference
-   üîó **Unified API** - No distinction between regular and computed signals
-   ‚ú® **Effects** - Side effects that run when signals change
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Proxy-based** - Deep reactivity for objects, arrays, and collections
-   üì¶ **Zero Dependencies** - No external dependencies required

## Installation

Install ProxSignal using npm:

```bash
npm install proxsignal
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Create signals with primitive values:

```typescript
import { Signal } from "proxsignal";

const count = new Signal(0);
console.log(count.v); // 0

count.v = 10;
console.log(count.v); // 10
```

### Computed Signals

Create computed signals by passing a function:

```typescript
import { Signal } from "proxsignal";

const a = new Signal(5);
const b = new Signal(10);

// Create a computed signal
const sum = new Signal(() => a.v + b.v);
console.log(sum.v); // 15

// Update a signal value - computed signals automatically recompute
a.v = 7;
console.log(sum.v); // 17
```

### Switching Between Values and Computations

One of ProxSignal's key features is that the same signal can seamlessly switch between holding a static value and being a computed signal. This flexibility allows you to change how a signal behaves at runtime:

```typescript
import { Signal } from "proxsignal";

const a = new Signal(5);
const b = new Signal(10);

// Start with a static value
let result = new Signal(15);
console.log(result.v); // 15

// Convert to a computed signal that depends on a and b
result.v = () => a.v + b.v;
console.log(result.v); // 15 (5 + 10)

// Update dependencies - computed signal automatically recomputes
a.v = 7;
console.log(result.v); // 17 (7 + 10)

// Convert back to a static value
result.v = 100;
console.log(result.v); // 100

// You can even make a signal depend on another computed signal
const multiplier = new Signal(2);
result.v = () => a.v * multiplier.v;
console.log(result.v); // 14 (7 * 2)

multiplier.v = () => b.v / 2;
console.log(result.v); // 35 (7 * 5, since multiplier.v = 10 / 2 = 5)
```

With ProxSignal, signals are flexible and can seamlessly shift between static values and dynamic computations at any time.

### The `.v` Property

The `.v` property is your main interface for reading and writing signal values:

-   **Reading**: Use `signal.v` to get the current value
-   **Writing**: Use `signal.v = value` to update the value
-   **Reading in computed functions**: When creating computed signals, read dependencies using `otherSignal.v` inside the function

**Important**: `.v` is a property, not a function. Don't call it as `signal.v()`.

### Deep Reactivity

Signals can hold objects, arrays, Map, Set, and Classes. Any nested property becomes automatically reactive:

```typescript
import { Signal } from "proxsignal";

const person = new Signal({
	name: "Alice",
	address: { city: "Wonderland" },
});

const name = new Signal(() => person.v.name);

// Update nested properties directly - reactivity works at any depth
person.v.name = "Bob";
console.log(name.v); // "Bob"
```

### Effects

Use `.onChange` to react to updates in a `Signal`:

```typescript
import { Signal } from "proxsignal";

const name = new Signal("Alice");

const message = new Signal(() => `Hello, ${name.v}!`);

// Register an effect that runs whenever message or its dependencies change
message.onChange(() => {
	console.log(message.v);
});

name.v = "Bob"; // Logs: Hello, Bob!
```

### Effect Batching

Effects are automatically batched within the same microtask. If you update several signals synchronously, effects run only once after all updates:

```typescript
const first = new Signal("A");
const last = new Signal("Z");

function logFull() {
	console.log(`Full: ${first.v} ${last.v}`);
}

first.onChange(logFull);
last.onChange(logFull);

// Changing both signals synchronously
first.v = "B";
last.v = "Y";
// logFull() runs only once after both have changed (not twice)
```
